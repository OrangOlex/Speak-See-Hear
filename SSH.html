        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>Thank you for playing Speak See Hear! This game does have blood, gore, violence, jump scares, mention of child abuse and death, if any of these topics bother you please proceed with caution. Now the controls of the game are simple when ()'s appear follow the instructions inside them. If the ()'s have {} in them the right hand side has either yes or no or tells you to press enter, on the left it tells you what that option is.</p>
